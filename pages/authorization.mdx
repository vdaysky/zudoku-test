title: Authorization in Python SDK
---

The Python SDK generated by OpenAPI Generator uses the `BearerAuth` security scheme for authorization. This scheme requires a JSON Web Token (JWT) to be included in the `Authorization` header of each request.

# Example

```python

from openapi_client.api_client import ApiClient
from openapi_client.configuration import Configuration

# Create a configuration instance
config = Configuration()
config.access_token = 'your_jwt_token_here'

# Create an ApiClient instance with the configuration
api_client = ApiClient(configuration=config)

# Now you can use the api_client to make authorized API calls
```
