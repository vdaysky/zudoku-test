# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Hardware Secret Manager** â€” a secure, microcontroller-based device for managing sensitive data (secrets), with strict access and transaction verification mechanisms.

### 1.2 Scope
The Hardware Secret Manager provides secure storage for secrets (e.g., passwords, tokens, cryptographic keys) on a microcontroller. It encrypts stored data, communicates with a host device via USB, and enforces two-factor authentication (PIN + key card) for all access and operations.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a standalone hardware device that acts as a secure vault for secrets. It connects to a host device (PC, server, etc.) over USB and is recognized via a custom USB protocol.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Securely store, retrieve, and delete secrets.
- Authenticate user access via PIN and key card.
- Encrypt all memory contents on-device.
- Require key card for each sensitive transaction.
- Communicate securely with host via USB.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
Users are expected to have basic understanding of hardware devices and security practices. Admin-level users should understand secure initialization and management procedures.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Secure Secret Storage
- Secrets are stored in the microcontroller's internal or connected memory.
- All secrets must be encrypted using a secure, hardware-supported encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256).

### 3.2 Authentication and Unlocking
- The device remains locked until a valid PIN and key card are presented.
- Unlock state is maintained only in volatile memory (reset on power loss).

### 3.3 Transaction Verification
- Every sensitive operation (read/write/delete secret) must be confirmed with a key card.
- The key card communicates with the device via a secure protocol (e.g., NFC, physical contact).

### 3.4 USB Communication
- The device communicates with the host through USB.
- A custom or HID-like protocol will be used for command and data exchange.
- All communication should be authenticated and optionally encrypted.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

### 4.1 Security
- Memory encryption is mandatory and must use hardware cryptographic support.
- PIN and key card data must never be stored unencrypted.
- Device must self-lock after a defined number of failed attempts.

### 4.2 Performance
- The device should unlock and respond to commands within 1 second.
- Read/write operations should complete in under 500 ms for typical secret sizes (&lt;1 KB).

### 4.3 Reliability
- The device must ensure secrets are not corrupted under power loss.
- Wear-leveling or similar techniques should be considered if flash memory is used.

### 4.4 Usability
- Feedback should be provided via LED indicators or host messages.
- User errors (e.g., wrong PIN, missing key card) should return informative status codes.

## 5. External Interfaces

### 5.1 USB Interface
- Connects to host devices via USB 2.0 or higher.
- Uses a defined command set for operations (e.g., `LOCK`, `UNLOCK`, `READ_SECRET`, `WRITE_SECRET`, `DELETE_SECRET`).

### 5.2 Key Card Interface
- Supports external key card (e.g., via NFC or dedicated slot).
- Verifies key card authenticity before allowing operations.
